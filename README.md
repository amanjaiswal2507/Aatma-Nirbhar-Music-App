# Aatma-Nirbhar-Music-App
This is a self learning project for better understanding of javascript, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap named as Aatma-Nirbhar Music App.
In main page, you will see the headphone icon which will directly lead to the first song of my playlist.
Below the Headphone Icon, you will found six icons over there which are as follows:
1. Playlist page ( from where you can see all the songs added in this app, and you can directly go to your own choice song too)
2. About Me page ( My intro page)
3. Instagram
4. Facebook
5. linkedin
6. Github

App is supported better in chrome than firefox, opera, IE,etc. Except for the Progressbar, it will not work properly in chrome.
